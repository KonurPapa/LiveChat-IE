# LiveChatIE
LiveChatIE (Improved Edition) is the greatly improved, second edition of the original LiveChat chat manager for Khan Academy users. LiveChat is geared towards collaborations and general chatters alike, providing the same reliable service regardless of the user. It is currently being built (and can be viewed under construction) here:

LiveChat was designed to fix issues many people have with the typical posting method on Khan Academy. The comment system they use gives a notification if a new post is received, and the page must be reloaded to view it. In contrast, LiveChatIE gives notifications only to the server owner, and new posts are displayed as they come in without reloading necessary.

In addition to this, LiveChat has many extra features such as exact post date, image display, list of users in the chat, and more. A new chat can be set up in minutes, and joining an existing chat takes moments. It's an intuitive system designed around you, with help provided just in case you get stuck.

And with the combined security of the Khan Academy Discussion Guidelines and a strict built-in blacklist, you can chat in peace knowing that you won't see anything jarring or inappropriate. Approved by the Khan Academy Guardians, LiveChat is as harmless as an ordinary comment (but with far better features).

LiveChatIE is the better way to chat on Khan Academy. Thanks for taking a look, hopefully LiveChat is as helpful for you as is has been for so many others.
